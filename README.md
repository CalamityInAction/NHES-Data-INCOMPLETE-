# NHES-Data-INCOMPLETE-

I tried to get the code working and put in all the necessary values from the codebook, but I was just not able to get the file name right so that it would import properly, meaning I couldn't run the code to completion. I am hoping that we can correct and resolve this issue in class. Thank you for your time :)
